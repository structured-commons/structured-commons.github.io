Organization
============

:slug: org

The Structured Commons **Technical Steering Committee** (SCTSC) is a
self-appointed, non-profit group of technology-minded scholars
responsible for maintaining a set of "core" specification documents
and reference/example tool implementations, and *publish them in the
public domain*.

Membership to the committee is free but candidate members should be
affiliated with a recognized academic institution, provide evidence of
basic expertise with the dynamics of academic publishing (including,
but not limited to, an established publication record), and "opted in"
by existing members.

Eventually, this steering committee is intended to be superseded by a
network of organizations that follow the Structured Commons model,
using the **core fingerprinting and citation formats** as common
vehicle.

Works maintained by the SCTSC

  documents that describe and specify the Structured Commons model and network.
