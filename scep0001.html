<h2>What is a&nbsp;<span class="caps">SCEP</span></h2>
<p><span class="caps">SCEP</span> stands for Structured Commons Enhancement Proposal.  A <span class="caps">SCEP</span> is a
design document providing information to the Structured Commons
community, or describing a new feature for the Structured Commons
methods and protocols. The <span class="caps">SCEP</span> should provide a concise technical
specification of the feature and a rationale for the&nbsp;feature.</p>
<p>We intend SCEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into Structured Commons. The <span class="caps">SCEP</span>
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting&nbsp;opinions.</p>
<p>Because the SCEPs are maintained as reStructured text files in a
versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record
of the feature proposal <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id1">[1]</a>. The list of all defined SCEPs is
maintained as <span class="caps">SCEP</span> 0 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#scep-0" id="id2">[3]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scep-types">
<h2><span class="caps">SCEP</span>&nbsp;Types</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of&nbsp;<span class="caps">SCEP</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A Standards Track <span class="caps">SCEP</span> describes an extension to one of the
Structured Commons protocols, or a change in the behavior of one
of the actors in these&nbsp;protocols.</li>
<li>An Informational <span class="caps">SCEP</span> describes a Structured Commons design issue, or
provides general guidelines or information to the Structured Commons
community, but does not propose an extension. Informational SCEPs
do not necessarily represent a Structured Commons community consensus or
recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore
Informational SCEPs or follow their&nbsp;advice.</li>
<li>A Process <span class="caps">SCEP</span> describes a process surrounding the Structured Commons, or
proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process SCEPs are
like Standards Track SCEPs but apply to areas other than the
Structured Commons protocols.  They are more than recommendations, and
users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include
release schedules, procedures, guidelines, changes to the
decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment
used in Structured Commons&nbsp;development.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<div class="section" id="scep-work-flow">
<h2><span class="caps">SCEP</span> Work&nbsp;Flow</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">SCEP</span> editors assign <span class="caps">SCEP</span> numbers and change their status.
Please send all <span class="caps">SCEP</span>-related email to &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:editors&#64;structured-commons.org">editors&#64;structured-commons.org</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">SCEP</span> process begins with a new idea for the Structured Commons
protocols. It is highly recommended that a single <span class="caps">SCEP</span> contain a single
key proposal. The <span class="caps">SCEP</span> editor reserves the right to reject <span class="caps">SCEP</span>
proposals if they appear unfocussed or overly broad. If in doubt,
split your <span class="caps">SCEP</span> into muliple&nbsp;SCEPs.</p>
<p>Each <span class="caps">SCEP</span> must have a champion &#8212; someone who writes the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> using
the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the
appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around
the idea. The <span class="caps">SCEP</span> champion should first post a description of the
idea to the SCEPs mailing list at:
<a class="reference external" href="http://lists.structured-commons.org/mailman/listinfo/sc-discuss">http://lists.structured-commons.org/mailman/listinfo/sc-discuss</a></p>
<p>If the champion believes the idea warrants a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> then the champion
emails the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> editor &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:editors&#64;structured-commons.org">editors&#64;structured-commons.org</a>&gt; with a proposed title
and a draft of the <span class="caps">SCEP</span>. This draft must be written in <span class="caps">SCEP</span> style as
described&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>If the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> editor approves, he assigns the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> a number, labels it
as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, gives it status
&#8220;Draft&#8221;, and creates and checks-in the initial draft of the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> to
the subversion repository. The <span class="caps">SCEP</span> editor will not unreasonably deny
a <span class="caps">SCEP</span>. Reasons for denying <span class="caps">SCEP</span> status include duplication of effort,
being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or not
addressing backwards compatibility. The Structured Commons Technical
Steering Committee can be consulted during the approval phase, and is
the final arbiter of the draft&#8217;s&nbsp;<span class="caps">SCEP</span>-ability.</p>
<p>If a pre-<span class="caps">SCEP</span> is rejected, the author may elect to take the pre-<span class="caps">SCEP</span> to
the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> forum seeking feedback and consesnsus from the community at large.
A proposal may be re-submitted after it has been&nbsp;revised.</p>
<p>The champion is then responsible for marshaling community support for
it. As updates are necessary, the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> author can check in new
versions if they have commit permissions on the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> repository, or
can email new <span class="caps">SCEP</span> versions to the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> editors for&nbsp;committing.</p>
<p>Standards Track SCEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation. The reference implementation need not be
complete when a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> is submitted to the editors.  However Standards
Track SCEPs must include an implementation with publicy available code
before it can be considered&nbsp;Final.</p>
<p><span class="caps">SCEP</span> champions are responsible for collecting community feedback on a
<span class="caps">SCEP</span> before submitting it for review. A <span class="caps">SCEP</span> that has not been
discussed in the Structured Commons mailing lists will not be
accepted. However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions in
the mailing list should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions
efficient include: setting up a separate <span class="caps">SIG</span> forum for the topic,
having the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> author accept private comments in the early design
phases, setting up a wiki page, etc. <span class="caps">SCEP</span> authors should use their
discretion&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Once the authors have completed a <span class="caps">SCEP</span>, they must inform the <span class="caps">SCEP</span>
editors that it is ready for review. SCEPs are reviewed by the
Technical Steering Committee, who may accept or reject a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> or send
it back to the author(s) for revision. For a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> that is
pre-determined to be acceptable (e.g., it is an obvious win as-is
and/or its implementation already exists) the Technical Steering
Committee may also initiate a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> review, first notifying the <span class="caps">SCEP</span>
author(s) and giving them a chance to make&nbsp;revisions.</p>
<p>For a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed
enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The
proposed implementation, if applicable, must be functional and have
been tested in a live environment.  Supporting results from
analyses, testbed experiments and event-based simulations are also
recommended where appropriate.  A Standards Track document should
include the rationale behind a proposal and may briefly summarize
analytical, simulation, or experimental results where necessary to
illustrate or motivate the enhancement.  However, detailed analytical,
simulation, and experiment results, especially comparing different
approaches to the same problem should be omitted from Standards Track
SCEPs and instead cited from a published paper or a separate
Informational&nbsp;<span class="caps">SCEP</span>.</p>
<p>Once a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted
by the <span class="caps">BDFL</span>, the status will be changed to&nbsp;&#8220;Final&#8221;.</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">SCEP</span> can also be assigned status &#8220;Deferred&#8221;. The <span class="caps">SCEP</span> author or editor
can assign the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> this status when no progress is being made on the
<span class="caps">SCEP</span>. Once a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> is deferred, the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> editor can re-assign it to draft&nbsp;status.</p>
<p>A <span class="caps">SCEP</span> can also be &#8220;Rejected&#8221;. Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this&nbsp;fact.</p>
<p>SCEPs can also be replaced by a different <span class="caps">SCEP</span>, rendering the original
obsolete. This is intended for Informational SCEPs, where e.g. version 2 of
an <span class="caps">API</span> can replace version&nbsp;1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intellectual-property-and-structured-commons-standards">
<h2>Intellectual Property and Structured Commons&nbsp;Standards</h2>
<p>Any idea submitted in a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> will not be considered for standardization
if the idea is not in the public domain.  Before a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> can be
considered Final, all people (including the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> authors) or entities
with a claim on the intellectual property expressed in a <span class="caps">SCEP</span> must
assign in writing all intellectual property expressed in the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> to
the public domain.  If the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> authors lack the power to assign
intellectual property rights then they must disclose this fact before
the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> can be considered&nbsp;Final.</p>
<p>Furthermore <span class="caps">SCEP</span> authors should not knowingly propose anything in their
SCEPs that infringes on the intellectual property rights of&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>This policy statement should not be construed as meaning that <span class="caps">SCEP</span>
authors are required to assign software implementations of any
particular idea to the public domain. Structured Commons implementors may
retain all rights to their&nbsp;implementations.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>This document was derived heavily from <span class="caps">PEP</span>-0001 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id3">[2]</a>.  In many places
text was simply copied and modified.  Although the <span class="caps">PEP</span>-0001 text
was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they
are not responsible for its use in the Structured Commons Enhancement Process,
and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to
Structured Commons or the <span class="caps">SCEP</span> process.  Please direct all comments to the
