Participating
=============

How *you* can participate:

**As an author**, *any* of the following helps:
  - **display fingerprints** and Structured Commons access links for
    your content on your personal web page, blog or social network.
  - **announce** your work, even "non-public" objects, by registering
    **certificates of existence** and publishing your **object
    metadata** in part or in full in the Structured Commons network.
  - **request custom licensing** agreements when publishing your work
    with "traditional" journals or conferences, so you keep the
    right to distribute your own copies independently from your
    publisher. (Suprisingly, most publishers are willing to cooperate!)
  - **release your work on public data stores** to seed the Structured
    Commons network, when you own licensing rights or have the right
    to redistribute.

**As a scholar** who reads, cites or reviews scientific work, *any* of the following helps:
  - **use fingerprints** in citations when your new works refer to
    objects that already exist in the Structured Commons network.
  - **publish your reviews** in the Structured Commons network while
    you participate in conference program committees or journal
    editorial boards.
  - **publish post-hoc citations** when you discover a link between
    otherwise unconnected scientific works.
  - **use Structured Commons query engines** to discover and rank
    the "top" publications in your field, based on object metadata, published
    reviews and post-hoc citations.
  - **run a personal data store** to share non-public documents and digital objects
    with specific colleagues, friends, reviewers and selected peers.

**As a journal editor or conference organizer**, *any* of the following helps:
  - **advocate** Structured Commons best practices to authors
    and reviewers, especially pre-submission content registration
    and fingerprint-based citations.
  - **register review objects** in the Structued Commons network
    using certificates of existence during the review process.
  - **offer to publish reviews** to authors, after review processes are completed.

**As a publisher**, *any* of the following helps:
  - **Display fingerprints** next to Structured Commons content on your
    publication media.
  - Provide **access links** to one or more download methods
    in the Structured Commons network for both the **source** objects
    and the **representations** of the content you publish.

**As a supporting organization**, *any* of the following helps:
  - **provide services to authors** to support document creation,
    editing, packaging, fingerprinting and uploading to the Structured
    Commons network.
  - **run public data stores** to support object long-term storage,
    dissemination, access and metadata indexing.
  - **run query engines** and web portals for them to enable users
    search, filter and order object listings based on metadata.
  - **reward academic staff** who participate in the Structured Commons network
    by publishing new works or reviews.

**As a technology developer**, *any* of the following helps:
  - **Extend your databases** to include Structured Commons fingerprints
    and access links for online content.
  - **Define and publish fingerprinting methods** for new document formats with
    a separation between "source" and "published" forms.
  - **Design and implement metadata extraction algorithms** for Structured Commons digital objects
    without author-supplied metadata.
  - **Participate** in the Structured Commons technology steering committee by contributing
    protocol specifications, guidelines, reference implementations or advocacy materials.
