Mission statement
=================

:slug: mission

The goal of Structured Commons is to *optimize dissemination* and
reuse of scientific work, with four sub-goals:

1. **make dissemination faster**;
2. **promote open peer review**;
3. **lower the cost** of publishing, dissemination and access;
4. **guarantee the persistence and consistency** of the citation network over the very long term (50+ years).

The Structured Commons network and model *complement* public
repositories like `arXiv`__, `Wikimedia Commons`__, the `Common
Crawl`__, `Web Data Commons`__, etc., and *overlay* them with new
services for authors and scholars:

- to structure digital documents and citations and equip them for very long term persistence;
- to support distributed, independent and transparent ("open") peer review of scholarly work;
- to provide transparent evaluation methods for scientific works and
  researchers, including ranking and filtering of "top" publications, based on public evidence.

The Structured Commons publication channels *can* operate side by side
with existing publishers (of journals & conference proceedings), but
they also enable alternate business models that can compete
effectively with the pre-Internet publishing industry.
