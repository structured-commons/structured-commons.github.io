   **Structured Commons** is an alternate model for scholars to
   register, disseminate, filter and preserve scientific knowledge.

What are the Structured Commons?
--------------------------------

The Structured Commons consist of a *model* for scholars to publish
and interact with scientific work and a *network* of documents and
digital objects structured and connected to each other using
Structured Commons mechanisms.

The *Structured Commons model* consists of **standards**, **methods**
and **tools** to:

- compute citable **fingerprints** for documents and digital objects;
- generate and verify **certificates of existence**;
- structure, and produce download links to **durable archives** of documents and collections;
- organize, validate and reward **peer review** between scholars;
- mine, index and query  **document metadata** automatically.

An academic work or digital object published in the *Structured
Commons network* becomes:

- **independent**: content is stored, indexed and distributed across the
  Internet, without requiring a single host organization or
  repository to support its existence in the long term.
- **incorruptible**: citations and links use fingerprints that "digitally signs" all documents; any
  post-publication alteration invalidate existing fingerprints.
- **irrefutable**: certificates of existence guarantee a document
  existed not later than a specific date, and multiple certificates
  can be added to a document over time.
