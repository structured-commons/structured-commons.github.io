The initial ideas behind Structured Commons ("Academia 2.0") were
formulated in 2014 by a small group of scholars in Western Europe
[#]_.

The Structured Commons **Technical Steering Committee** (SCTSC) is a
self-appointed, non-profit group of technology-minded scholars
responsible for maintaining a set of "core" specification documents
and reference/example tool implementations, and *publish them in the
public domain*.

Membership to the committee is free but candidate members must be
affiliated to a recognized academic institution, provide evidence of
an established publication record, and "opted in" by existing members.

Eventually, this steering committee is intended to be superseded by a
network of organizations that follow the Structured Commons model,
using the **core fingerprinting and citation formats** as common
vehicle.
