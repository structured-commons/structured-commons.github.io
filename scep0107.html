<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Structured Commons network is composed of a structured network of
documents and accompanying <em>review objects</em>.  When reviews are
published, the content of reviews can be used to filter and sort
search results by users (typically readers), <em>in lieu</em> of the
traditional ranking of works based on publisher-determined and often
inaccurate &quot;impact factors&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#impact" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>This <span class="caps">SCEP</span> provides standard guidelines and recommendations
for structuring reviews in the Structured Commons&nbsp;network.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Background</a></h3>
<p><em>Peer review</em>, the evaluation of scientific outcomes by peers, is a
fundamental, defining aspect of modern science. It serves to
acknowledge the work of peers, assessing methodologies, checking
results, providing feedback, etc.  This aspect is
so strong that the <em>evaluation</em> of a scientific work, and by
extension the reputation and performance of its author(s), is largely
defined by the outcome of peer review as much as the impact (true or
perceived) of the scientific work&nbsp;itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Summary</a></h3>
<p>The content of the following sections can be summarized as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>structure the metadata</strong> of reviews whenever peer review is
organized, according to the guidelines described in <a class="reference internal" href="#common-model">Common model</a>&nbsp;below.</li>
<li><strong>List the object fingerprints</strong> of reviewed scientific works <em>and
of their reviews</em> in review&nbsp;outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>disseminate the metadata</strong> (including relationships and
fingerprints) <strong>widely, soon after publication</strong>, to ensure redundancy
of the structural&nbsp;links.</li>
<li>obtain and circulate <strong>certificates of existence</strong> for review
outcomes, to authenticate the structural&nbsp;links.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="peer-review-in-the-structured-commons-model">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Peer review in the Structured Commons&nbsp;model</a></h2>
<p>The Structured Commons model embraces peer review, while innovating on
the actors of the peer review process. Whereas, historically,
<em>publishers</em> have been responsible for selecting reviewers, collecting
reviews and selecting works for publication based on review outcomes,
the Structured Commons model proposes&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>all works are potentially published, regardless of review&nbsp;outcomes;</li>
<li><em>review objects</em> become publishable,&nbsp;too;</li>
<li>individual <em>reviewers</em> and <em>review committees</em> take ownership of the
review&nbsp;process;</li>
<li><em>readers</em>, and by extension anyone interested in the ranking of
scientific works, uses published review objects to rank and filter
works in search&nbsp;results.</li>
</ul>
<p>This vision removes the need for third parties (eg. industrial
publishers) to organize peer review review, but the <em>organization</em> of
peer review can remain largely&nbsp;unchanged:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>groups of scholars self-appoint themselves with a common goal, the
publication of a collection of works related to a common topic (the
theme of a journal issue or conference in the traditional model),
at a set <em>publication date</em> (issue date or conference date), and
subject to a predetermined <em>review process</em> (open, blind,
double-blind, etc).  In doing so, they define a <em>publication
event</em>;</li>
<li>the group publishes and disseminates a &quot;call for submissions&quot; to
experts in their field, announcing the theme, publication date and
review&nbsp;process;</li>
<li>upon submissions by experts, the group members (or other
distinguished experts that they appoint as reviewers on their
behalf) follow the review process, to create reviews of the
submitted&nbsp;works;</li>
<li>upon the previously agreed publication date, the group announces
and release the <em>review outcomes</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The motivation for publishing the review outcomes is twofold.  For the
submitters, it provides the direct feedback of peer review. For the
rest of the world, it creates an historical record of the opinion of
the reviewers about the works that were submitted. This record can
also be subsequently used to filter and present lists of works when
other scholar search for materials relevant to their study, in
replacement for the traditional &quot;ranking&quot; implicitly performed
by impact&nbsp;factors.</p>
<div class="section" id="diversity-of-review-processes-and-outcomes">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Diversity of review processes and&nbsp;outcomes</a></h3>
<!-- The section above explained how to generalize the process around
traditional academic journals and conferences, so that it can be
followed by publisher-less organizations. The goal of that section is
to show that it is possible to keep the same sort of review outcomes,
when so desired, even without involving industrial publishers. -->
<p>Scholars may, and often do, desire to exploit different
<em>review processes</em> and thus reach qualitatively different review
outcomes, depending on&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
<p>To start with, existing journals and peer-reviews conferences use a
threshold-based review process: its goal is to separate &quot;rejected&quot;
from &quot;accepted&quot; papers, by filtering submissions using a threshold
value on a common evaluation scale. This process already exists in
different variants, depending on how reviewer neutrality was
organized: a <em>blind</em> review process ensures that authors do not know the
identity of reviewers, a <em>double-blind</em> process ensures that neither
authors nor reviewers know each other identity,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a diversity of other review processes and outcomes
are also used, possibly simultaneously, around scientific works, for&nbsp;example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the outcome of a <em>ranking</em> process is the full list of submissions,
ranked according to a common&nbsp;scale.</li>
<li>the outcome of a <em>discussion</em> process is a mapping from all
submissions to one or more comments about&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>the outcome of a <em>tagging</em> process is a mapping from all submissions
to one or more tags that identify their topic of study, area of
expertise,&nbsp;etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on context (eg. the applicability of a scientific work, the
current tradition in the community of experts, etc.), different
scholar communities will likely choose for different types of review
outcomes, and different ways to reach these outcomes. These
preferences may even evolve over&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>This is why <strong>the Structured Commons network registers the
organization of the review process alongside all review outcomes</strong>, so
that reviews can be interpreted and placed back in their context long
after the particular technology or tacit know-how has been&nbsp;lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="forward-compatibility-and-decentralized-characterization">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Forward-compatibility and decentralized&nbsp;characterization</a></h3>
<p><strong>The Structured Commons network captures review
processes and outcomes after they have been used and produced</strong>, by
<em>describing</em> processes and reviews using metadata and <em>linking</em>
both the reviewed objects and their reviews <em>using their fingerprints</em>.</p>
<p>The fact that review relationships are &quot;encapsulated&quot; using
meta-objects in the Structured Commons network enables two
adoption avenues&nbsp;simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">the integration of Structured Commons features in existing review
platforms (eg. EasyChair) can be implemented as an <em>extension</em> of the
platform, which is usually easier to achieve and to deploy
than pervasive changes or changes that disrupt user&nbsp;habits;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">meanwhile, any outcome produced by systems not aware
of the Structured Commons network can also be encapsulated
in the Structured Commons network after they are&nbsp;produced.</p>
<p>This second point means that review processes <em>can</em> be organized
outside of the Structured Commons model, reviewers <em>may</em> be
oblivious of the Structured Commons vision, and review objects <em>may</em>
be edited and maintained in systems that do not support Structured
Commons concepts directly, and <em>yet</em> the entire outcome of the
review process can be described inserted in the Structured Commons
network, <em>a posteriori</em>, and the value of reviews exploited for
sorting and filtering works in search&nbsp;queries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Rationale</a></h3>
<p>It may be tempting to codify the registration of reviews
in the Structured Commons network by first designing a fixed set of &quot;standard review processes&quot;,
give them centrally managed &quot;identifiers&quot; and then mandate that
&quot;platforms must implement the standard processes to be recognized as
valid Structured Commons implementations&quot; and/or &quot;must report the
standard process identifier in review objects&quot;. It may also be tempting to
codify a single &quot;schema&quot; to create review objects and then mandate
that &quot;objects must be compatible with this schema to be recognized as
a valid Structured Commons review&nbsp;object&quot;.</p>
<p>This approach would be undesirable for two main&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it would concentrate the responsibility to design review processes
in the hands of a few (namely, those people in charge of the
standardization), which runs contrary to the Structured
Commons&nbsp;vision;</li>
<li>it would be a barrier to adoption, as many other participants in
scientific publishing already have their well-established best
practices on how to organize peer&nbsp;review.</li>
</ul>
<p>The approach described below avoids these two&nbsp;pitfalls.</p>
<p>The proposed approach is also storage-agnostic: the structured metadata
of reviews can be distributed, copied, served using a variety
of channels (including paper-and-ink, if need be), independently
from a single&nbsp;organization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="common-model">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Common&nbsp;model</a></h2>
<p>The process to capture peer review in the Structured Commons network
is to create an object dictionary containing the following&nbsp;fields:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>subject</strong>: a collection of works being&nbsp;reviewed,</li>
<li><strong>annotation</strong>: a collection of reviews about the&nbsp;subject,</li>
<li><strong>meta</strong>: a description of the review&nbsp;process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such an object dictionary is called a <strong>review binding</strong> in the Structured Commons&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>The <em>subject</em> field can either refer to <a class="footnote-reference" href="#rt" id="id2">[3]</a> a single work by fingerprint,
or to a dictionary that refers to multiple works. If a dictionary
is used, <em>the names in the subject dictionary must not be significant</em>:
any references to members of the <em>subject</em> field in the <em>annotation</em> or <em>meta</em>
fields must use Structured Common&nbsp;fingerprints.</p>
<p>Names in the subject field can be constructed arbitrarily, for example
using the advisory title and author list of the referred&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>The <em>annotation</em> field can either refer to <a class="footnote-reference" href="#rt" id="id3">[3]</a> a single review object,
or to a dictionary that refers to multiple review objects.  If a
dictionary is used, <em>the names in the reviews dictionary may be
significant</em>, depending on the review process as indicated by the
<em>meta</em>&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>The <em>meta</em> field provides information about the review process
and how to intepret the structure of the <em>annotation</em> field. It must
contain at least the following&nbsp;fields:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>start</strong></dt>
<dd>The starting date (and optionally time)
of the review process, encoded using <span class="caps">ISO</span> 8601 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#iso8601" id="id4">[4]</a> (eg. <span class="caps">YYYY</span>-<span class="caps">MM</span>-<span class="caps">DD</span>);</dd>
<dt><strong>end</strong></dt>
<dd>The ending date (and optionally time) of the review&nbsp;process.</dd>
<dt><strong>title</strong></dt>
<dd>The preferred title for the review binding as a whole. This is
typically the conference or journal name with year in the
traditional model, or &quot;Reviews for &quot; followed by the subject title
and the time period, for self-published review bindings referring to
a single&nbsp;object.</dd>
<dt><strong>authors</strong></dt>
<dd>An informative description of the entity (person, group or
organization) responsible for <em>creating the review binding</em> (ie. not
the authors of the works listed in the <em>subject</em> field, unless they
are also reviewers or in charge of producing the review binding).
For example, this may be the list of program committee members in a
conference, the list of authors of the objects listed in the
<em>annotation</em> field, the name of the software responsible for
importing review outcomes automatically from an external source into
the Structured Commons network,&nbsp;etc.</dd>
<dt><strong>info</strong></dt>
<dd>An informative description of the process used to produce
the objects referred to via the <em>annotation</em> field,
and how to interpret the contents of
the <em>annotation</em> field. Other SCEPs may/will provide
guidelines and best practices for structuring the <em>info</em>&nbsp;field.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Review objects (members of the <em>annotation</em> field) should, whenever
possible and relevant, refer to the objects in the subject field using
their Structured Commons fingerprint. These structural links
can be subsequently used by Structured Commons query engines to
present contextual information to users in search&nbsp;results.</p>
<div class="section" id="authentication">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Authentication</a></h3>
<p>To authenticate review bindings, the standard Structured Commons
methods&nbsp;apply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the authors of review bindings should seek and register
<strong>certificates of existence</strong> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#scep102" id="id5">[5]</a> for the entire review
binding object <strong>within the announced review process interval</strong>
(<em>start</em> and <em>end</em>&nbsp;fields);</li>
<li>the <strong>fingerprint</strong> of review binding objects should be disseminated
into a variety of media, themselves authentified via
certificate of existence close to the announced review process&nbsp;interval;</li>
<li><strong>search results</strong> for queries onto the Structured Commons network
must present the known certificates of existence alongside
review bindings to&nbsp;users;</li>
<li>over time, directories of &quot;reputable&quot; review binding authors or
processes will appear, together with education materials for users
of the Structured Commons network that helps them construct relevant
search&nbsp;queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the particular case where review bindings are created a posteriori
on top of a collection of review objects produced outside
of the Structured Commons network, and <em>where the existing review objects
already contain all the information needed to construct the review
binding object</em>, any certificate of existence that
attests separately all review objects in the collection can be used
as certificate of existence for the review binding&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>This extra possibility makes it possible to reuse and authenticate
past review outcomes in the Structured Commons network, without the
need for back-dated certificates of existence (as back-dated CoEs
would violate the Structured Commons contract on&nbsp;CoEs).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="long-term-preservation">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Long-term&nbsp;preservation</a></h3>
<p>In the traditional model, a &quot;journal issue&quot; or &quot;conference
proceedings&quot; is a document that <em>cristallizes</em> the outcome of a
publication event. This is achieved by <em>compiling all accepted works
into a single book</em>, booklet or magazine, that is subsequentely
<em>widely disseminated</em> in libraries around the world, usually using&nbsp;paper-and-ink.</p>
<p>Even without following the traditional model, the Structured Commons
model acknowledges that this cristallization is essential: <em>long after
the publication event has passed</em>, in particular after its organizers
have disbanded or have forgotten about their involvement, and the web
sites related to the event have themselves disappeared <a class="footnote-reference" href="#lr" id="id6">[2]</a>, the
<em>distributed repository of copies of archived collections</em> should
serve as witness of the review outcomes; so that anyone can stay free
to compare copies across multiple libraries and satisfy themselves
that they list an accepted work, follow a known review process, were
published at a known date,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>This is why <strong>the creators of review binding objects should seek wide
dissemination and long-term perservation of the review bindings,</strong>
and technology platforms around the Structured Commons network
should give extra attension to the long-time persistence of all review&nbsp;bindings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="query-engines-and-result-filtering">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Query engines and result&nbsp;filtering</a></h3>
<p>The goal of review bindings is to influence the ranking and filtering
of search results in query engines, when users query the
Structured Commons network for &quot;all works referred to by
review bindings&quot; or &quot;all works for which a predicate
holds on known review&nbsp;bindings&quot;.</p>
<p>To ensure that the network remains impervious to malicious insertions
of illegitimate review bindings, the following extra measures must be&nbsp;taken:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>query engines and/or users must account for/use certificates
of existence, and give higher precedence to review bindings with
certificates of existence falling in the announced <em>start-end</em>&nbsp;interval.</li>
<li>query engines and/or users must give higher precedence to review
bindings that are referred to by other objects, with certificates
of existence closer to the <em>end</em>&nbsp;date.</li>
<li>there must exist a trusted oracle that authentifies new review
bindings for a limited amount of time after their publication,
sufficiently long to accrue references from other objects
in the Structured Commons network
(eg. a trusted web site listing valid review binding fingerprints
can be available for at least a year or two after the objects
are&nbsp;published).</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirement in this second assumption is motivated as follows: as
explained in <span class="caps">SCEP</span> 102 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#scep102" id="id7">[5]</a>, section &quot;Very long term
durability&quot;, once a network of citations with certificates of
existence exists, the trusted oracle can be removed and the network of
citations can serve as substitute to authenticate&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>Once these two measures are taken, fake reviews are blocked
from impacting search results&nbsp;significantly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">fake review bindings created after the <em>end</em> date of  &quot;good&quot;
review binding cannot obtain a valid certificate of
existence that falls in the time&nbsp;interval;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">fake review bindings created before the end date of a &quot;good&quot; review
binding, with valid certificates of&nbsp;existence:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if the fake review binding is injected in the network soon after
the <em>end</em> date: the trusted oracle will prevent the accretion of a
citation network, while the &quot;good&quot; object will accrue&nbsp;citations;</li>
<li>if the fake review binding is injected in the network long after
the <em>end</em> date, eg. when the trusted oracle is not available any
more: from then on, it will be impossible for the fake object to
accrue older citations than those that already exist for the &quot;good&quot;&nbsp;object.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the &quot;good&quot; object is favored in search results, because it
has the earlier network of attested&nbsp;citations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
